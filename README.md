## sjpplog_ng

This is based on the original [sjpplog](http://pplog.scottjarvis.com/)
which is in turn based on Fedukun's [pplog](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pplog/),
a single `perl` script that controls an entire blog! No need for SQL data bases
as all data is kept in flat files.

### So what is different? 

 - _multiuser_ capability: the blog can have multiple posters
 - beefed up security
 - extra fetures such as extra sharing options and a new "hit" map by @jamesbond3142;
 see [here](http://www.lightofdawn.org/blog/?viewDetailed=00030)
 - other bugfixes and enhancements
 
### So who is using it?

 - Puppy Linux blog
